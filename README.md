#### Expandability
* The game itself can be easiliy expanded, since the code takes care of all the logic.
* Making a new level is just artistry, using existing abstractions to model a new scene.
* There can be virtually unlimited numbers of players on the screen, there is an example with 3 in the game.

### Remarks

* There was an attempt for a sinmple plot, but screen space limited the story to just a few sentences.
